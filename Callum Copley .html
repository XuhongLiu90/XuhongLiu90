        <h1>Impact of “Premeditation” on Communication</h1>
        <p>
            I love this passage. It explores the impact of “premeditation” on communication. Theorist Richard Grusin points out that both news and social media are increasingly concerned with predicting the future rather than reporting on current events. Alerts such as “A friend is typing” are designed to create the sense that “something important is about to happen” and thus capture the user's attention. This approach is driven by the attention economy, which prolongs the user's stay and engagement on the platform by generating anticipation of what's to come. We need to be aware that these designs may inadvertently affect our attention and time allocation.
