    <h1>Reflection on Handmade Computer by Taeyoon Choi</h1>
    <p>
        Taeyoon Choi’s <em>Handmade Computer</em> blends technology, history, and philosophy, offering a fresh look at the relationship between humans and computers. Choi begins by exploring the origins of the term "computer," once referring to human laborers doing calculations, and contrasts this with the modern mythology of Silicon Valley. He critiques how our tech advancements often hide the social and political forces behind them, like militarization and state power.

        Choi draws an interesting parallel between cities and computers, comparing urban infrastructure to computational circuits. However, while computers follow logical rules, cities remain chaotic and unpredictable, showing that not everything in life can be reduced to binary. His project challenges the growing opacity of modern tech, pushing for a deeper understanding of the systems we use daily.

        By connecting computation with art, urbanization, and human experience, Choi shows us that technology is not just about function—it’s about how we interact with and shape the world around us. His journey through building a computer from scratch reveals the hidden layers behind technology and encourages us to ask: what kind of tech do we want, and what world do we want to build with it?

        Taeyoon Choi in Handmade Computer mentions that as technology has become more complex, interfaces, while simpler, have distanced users from how the technology really works. This makes us more like passive users, and Choi encourages hands-on exploration of technology to increase transparency and give users a deeper understanding of the tools they rely on.
