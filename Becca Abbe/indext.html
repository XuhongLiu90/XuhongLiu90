        <h1>Impact of “Premeditation” on Communication</h1>
        <p>
            This article explores the connection between the Internet and the back-to-the-land movement, reflecting on the finiteness of global resources and the depletion of resources in the digital world. The article reveals the crisis of human growth through the Club of Rome and The Limits to Growth, and introduces alternatives like Fukuoka's Natural Farming Method and Low Tech Magazine to promote sustainable lifestyles. It got me thinking that digital spaces, like the physical world, have limited resources and that we need to be more conscious of how we manage and use them, looking for models of networking that are out of the mainstream and back to localisation.
