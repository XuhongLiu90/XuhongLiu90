            9.3  J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web   
            This article made me realize the unique value of “hand-crafted pages” in the early days of the Internet and their relevance in today's digital culture. Author J.R. Carpenter looks back at the development of the web from the mid to late 1990s and describes the hand-coded, personalized, and spontaneous web pages of that era. These web pages not only displayed the unique style of their creators, but also represented a passion for free expression and creativity.</p>
        
        <p>The authors note that over time, this spontaneity and hand-crafted quality has been gradually replaced by commercialized and standardized web pages. The modern web is dominated by corporations, with highly standardized page designs and increasingly specialized tools used. This shift has not only changed the appearance of web pages, but has also affected the way users interact with them, especially in the context of the proliferation of mobile devices, which make users more consumers of content than creators.</p>
        
        <p>The authors call for us to revisit the value of “hand-crafted web pages” as a form of resistance to the current highly commercialized web environment. The experimental web art of hand-coding and self-publishing is particularly valuable today, not only for its adherence to technology, but also for its preservation of individual expression and cultural diversity. This essay reminds us that in the face of the ever-changing digital environment, we should not forget the pure spirit of creativity and the value of free expression that the early web embodied.</p>
