        <h1>Impact of “Premeditation” on Communication</h1>
        <p>
            In his talk ‘The Good Room’, Frank Chimero discussed how technology has transformed from a tool to a ‘place’ where we live. He used the contrast between the New York Public Library and Penn Station to illustrate how technology should exist: the library symbolises an open, inclusive space that provides nourishment and support for all, whereas today's Penn Station symbolises the indifference and oppression that comes with commercialisation.

            Chimero argues that our digital lives are overly reliant on convenience and endless interaction, leading to anxiety, exhaustion, and even a loss of trust. He proposes the concept of ‘soul tech,’ which advocates that the purpose of technology is to help people find meaning, not just to satisfy business needs. He suggests that, like the Amish, we make careful choices about technology to ensure that it enhances family and community connections. At the centre of his argument is the idea that digital spaces, like libraries, should be warm, welcoming places where people can find spiritual nourishment and a sense of belonging.
